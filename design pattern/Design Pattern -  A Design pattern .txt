Design Pattern :-  A Design pattern in software development is a reusable solution to a commonly occuring problem. it provides template or set of guidelines for solving specific types of problem in consistent and efficient way.
   → it helps to create a organised, modular and easier to understand , maintain and extended that developed software.
   → the role of Design Pattern in software Development................

  » design patterns are well proved solution of commonly occuring problems in software Design.

          » In software development we face so many common probelems and every developer understand and try to solve in it's own way,           
            therefore design patten is way to solve that common problem in standard way , is known as Aproaches.  
          
          » Aproaches for solving genral or common problems which comes during software development or after development .
              
           Categorization of Design Pattern.........
             Creational Design Pattern :-- factory patttern , builder pattern , singleton Pattern etc.
             structural Design Pattern :-- proxy pattern , Adapter Pattern.
              Behavioral Design Pattern :-- observer Pattern , State pattern , iterator Pattern etc.

»»» """ Important Points """ 
    " Christopher Alexender was the first person who invented all the above Design Pattern in 1977."
    " But Later the gang of four - Design Pattern , elements of reusable object-oriented software book was written by a group of four person named as Erich Gamma , Richard Helm , Ralph Johnson and  John Vlissides in 1995.
